                    <span><strong>1.Describe your previous experiences with coding.</strong><br>
                    Last semester was my first time learning how to code. We had a semester-long project of creating a collection website about the topic that I like to do. It was a very fun project but was very challenging to create the things that I wanted to do with my limited coding experience.</span>

                        It was not a class or lecture, I read the resources that last semester's professor provided. Other than that,
                        I had to research through other websites, watch informative videos from YouTube, and Chat GPT helped me to learn about how to code.</span>

                        It was very interesting that I wrote words and it turned into visual things. Learning how to code gave me the experience of feeling thankful for how Adobe was making my life easier.</span>

                        The confusing and challenging part was I had no idea how to fix the codes that did not work the way that I wanted to.</span>

                    I am very excited about learning about code but feel nervous because I am not confident about it yet. I think the great way to reduce this anxiety is that the professor is showing the confidence of "I can definitely help you!" to the students.</span>

                        Coding is very important and popular these days in all different fields, I think it will be an essential thing when I enter a design career after college. Also, if I know how to code, I can create things that I want by myself and that will be very helpful for my design.</span>

                    HTML is bread, CSS is butter, and JavaScript is jam. We need HTML bread as a base, and CSS butter to add a variety of tastes. Finally, add JavaScript to add more fun taste.</span>

                            <p>Also, I love the posters with minimal designs. This looks very simple with black and white colour and simple fonts but looks very strong by using different font sizes to emphasize important information.</p>
