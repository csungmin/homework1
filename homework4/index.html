            This album express a colourful era where Korean traditional and modernity coexist.

            <br> <br> The overall story throughout this album got motif by Korean Traditional Fairy Tale and added some horror. 5 sisters who are trapped in a tragedy and waiting for hope. It focuses on the process of how the five sisters overcome their tragedies and grow through the proces. The musics in this album is also full of horror elements and hopeful elements in the background sound and lyrics.
            
            <br><br> Therefore, the album cover also with the visual effects of an oriental style with the horror theme. The designers came up with a letter "Red Velvet" that looks like Chinese characters (letters widely used in various Asian cultures in the past) on the frame. So it looks like an exisiting Chienes characters but actually they designed a new Chinese characters form with English characters.
